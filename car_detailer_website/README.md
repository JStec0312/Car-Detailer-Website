# Car Detailer

A simple Next.js project for a car detailing service.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

This is a minimal "Hello World" setup with the following structure:

```
src/
  app/
    globals.css     - Basic styling with Tailwind CSS
    layout.js       - Main layout component
    page.js         - Home page with "Hello World" message
```

## Future Development

This project will be expanded to build a full car detailing service website.
